# BMI-Calculator-Java

# Overview
The BMI Calculator is a simple Java-based application designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's height and weight.<br>
It calculates BMI into two systems : <br>
1. Imperial System -> Weight in Pounds and Height in Inches.<br>
2. Metric System -> Weight in Kilos and Height in Meters.<br>

This tool provides an easy way for users to determine their BMI and assess whether they fall into a healthy weight range.<br> The application uses a console-based interface for input and output and is ideal for learning basic Java programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, and mathematical operations upto some concepts like classes , instances.<br>

# Features :<br>
1. Calculate BMI: The user can input their height (in meters , inches) and weight (in kilograms , pounds), and the program will calculate their BMI using the formula:<br>
    -> Imperial : 703 * weight(in pounds) / (height * height) (in inches)<br>
    -> Metric : weight(in kilos) / (height * height) (in meters)<br>
   
2. BMI Categories: The program classifies the BMI result into categories such as: <br>
-> Underweight (>= 0 and < 18.5)<br>
-> Normal weight (>= 18.5 and < 25)<br>
-> Overweight (>= 25 and < 30)<br>
-> Obese (> 30)<br>

3. User Input Validation: The program checks if the user enters valid numeric values for height and weight.<br>
  
4. Simple CLI Interface: The application is operated through a command-line interface, making it easy to run on any system with a Java environment.<br>

# Technologies Used :<br>
1. Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the BMI Calculator.<br>
2. Console Application: The application uses the console for input and output.<br>
